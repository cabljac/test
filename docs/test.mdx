# Navigator Integration

If you'd like to integrate with the built in `Navigator` widget, you can, as
shown in this snippet from the [navigator integration
example](https://github.com/csells/go_router/blob/master/example/lib/navigator_integration.dart):

```dart
Future<void> _addPerson(BuildContext context) async {
  final person = await Navigator.push<Person>(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => NewPersonScreen(family: widget.family),
    ),
  );

  if (person != null) {
    setState(() => widget.family.people.add(person));
    context.goNamed('person', params: {
      'fid': widget.family.id,
      'pid': person.id,
    });
  }
}
```

This example shows how to use the `Navigator` widget to push a new page and
gather the result. It doesn't use the `GoRouter` but works just the way you'd
expect, e.g. it will create a new page on the stack of pages, show a Back button
in the `AppBar`, etc. To return results, use `Navigator.pop` as you normally
would:



You can feel free to use `GoRouter` and `Navigator` together like this. However,
one thing that using `Navigator.push` in this way will not do is update the
browser's address bar. If you want that, you'll need to use `GoRouter.go` or
`GoRouter.push`. You'll notice, however, that neither `go` nor `push` provides
for waiting on results. That's because `GoRouter` is meant for use with deep and
dynamic linking, i.e. everything about a location in your app can be expressed
as a link. If you're calling `Navigator.push` and waiting on the results from
some random place in your app, that's not something that can be represented in a
link.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't use `GoRouter` to navigate to a page
that gathers user input; in fact, that's a common scenario that `GoRouter`
supports. Because the results of the navigation are not available to the caller
when using the `GoRouter`, the screen itself would be responsible for managing
what happens to the user input, e.g.

With this implementation, you can set up a sub-route to provide a page to add a
new person:
