A Kähler-Einstein metric is a metric $ g $ on a Kähler Manifold such that 

$$
\text{Ric}_g = \lambda g
$$
 
 For some real number $ \lambda $.

When the anticanonical bundle $ K_{X}^{-1}$ is ample, or equivalently $ c_{1}(X)> 0$, the manifold is said to be Fano. In contrast to the case $ c_{1}(X)\leq 0$, a Kähler–Einstein metric does not always exist in this case.
